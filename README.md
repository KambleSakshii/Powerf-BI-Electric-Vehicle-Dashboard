## 💡 Project Overview
This project is a dynamic, interactive dashboard built to analyze the rapidly expanding Electric Vehicle (EV) market. The goal was to transform a large, complex dataset of EV registrations into **clear, actionable insights** for strategic business planning and market trend identification.

The dashboard focuses on answering critical business questions about market adoption, manufacturer dominance, and the shift from PHEV to BEV technology.

## 📊 Key Findings & Insights
The analysis of **150,000+** vehicle registration records revealed several key insights:

* **Dominance Shift:** Confirmed the significant market shift, quantifying **78% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)** market share over Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) across the dataset.
* **Critical Growth Period:** Identified the years **2020-2021** as a major inflection point for accelerating EV adoption.
* **Manufacturer Performance:** Tracked and visualized the performance of top manufacturers and their respective model popularity.
* **Range Analysis:** Provided a clear view of the **Average Electric Range** trend over time and across different vehicle makes.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
The following tools and languages were essential for this project:

* **Data Analysis & ETL:** **\[Python (Pandas, NumPy) / SQL]** - Used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
* **Data Visualization:** **\[Power BI / Tableau]** - The primary tool used for dashboard design, interaction, and report generation.
* **Data Source:** **\[Source of Data, e.g., Kaggle/Public Data API]** - Dataset containing over 150K EV registrations.

## ⚙️ Dashboard Features
The final dashboard includes the following interactive components:

* **Market Share Treemap:** Visualizing manufacturer market share by vehicle count.
* **Adoption Rate Line Chart:** Tracking monthly/quarterly registration trends.
* **BEV vs. PHEV Split:** A clear breakdown of vehicle type dominance.
* **Interactive Filters:** Allowing users to slice data by Year, Make, Model, and State/Region.
